```bash
cd /Users/anvitaprasad/Desktop/cnlabstuff
source .venv/bin/activate
python server.py
```
**→ The server will display its IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)**

#### Step 2: Start First Client
```bash
# Open a new terminal
cd /Users/anvitaprasad/Desktop/cnlabstuff
source .venv/bin/activate
python client.py
```
- Enter username: "Alice"
- Enter server IP: [the IP from Step 1]
- Click "Connect"

#### Step 3: Start Second Client (for testing)
```bash
# Open another new terminal
cd /Users/anvitaprasad/Desktop/cnlabstuff
source .venv/bin/activate
python client.py
```
- Enter username: "Bob"
- Enter server IP: [same IP]
- Click "Connect"

**Now you can test all features!**

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### System Permissions Required (macOS)
When you first run the client, macOS will ask for permissions:
- ✅ **Camera** - Grant access for video conferencing
- ✅ **Microphone** - Grant access for audio
- ✅ **Screen Recording** - Grant access for screen sharing

**Location:** System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy

### Network Requirements
- ✅ All devices must be on the **same LAN**
- ✅ Firewall must allow ports **5555** (TCP) and **5556** (UDP)
- ✅ No internet connection required

### Testing Recommendations
- ✅ Test with headphones to prevent audio echo
- ✅ Close other applications using camera/microphone
- ✅ Start with 2 clients, then add more
- ✅ Test each feature individually first

---

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Scalability**: Optimized for 3-5 users; performance degrades with 10+ users
2. **No Encryption**: All data transmitted unencrypted (LAN-only use)
3. **No Authentication**: Username-based identification only
4. **Single Presenter**: Only one user can present at a time
5. **Memory-Based File Storage**: Files stored in RAM, lost on server restart

**These are acceptable for an educational LAN-based project.**
