## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP: HOW TO USE YOUR PROJECT

### **OPTION 1: Quick Demo (Recommended for First Time)**

This will test the system with GUI clients:

#### Step 1: Open a NEW Terminal Window
- Press `⌘ + N` (or File → New Window)

#### Step 2: Run First Client (Alice)
Copy and paste these commands:
```bash
cd /Users/anvitaprasad/Desktop/cnlabstuff
source .venv/bin/activate
python client.py
```

**A window will appear!** Fill in:
- **Username:** `Alice`
- **Server IP:** `127.0.0.1`
- **TCP Port:** `5555` (already filled)
- **UDP Port:** `5556` (already filled)
- Click **"Connect"**

**Expected:** Window changes to show the main interface with video grid, chat, etc.

#### Step 3: Open ANOTHER New Terminal Window
- Press `⌘ + N` again

#### Step 4: Run Second Client (Bob)
```bash
cd /Users/anvitaprasad/Desktop/cnlabstuff
source .venv/bin/activate
python client.py
```

**Fill in:**
- **Username:** `Bob`
- **Server IP:** `127.0.0.1`
- Click **"Connect"**

**Expected:** 
- Both Alice and Bob see each other in the Users list
- Chat message appears: "Bob joined the session"

#### Step 5: Test Each Feature

**A. Test Chat (30 seconds)**
1. In Alice's window: Type "Hello Bob!" → Press Enter
2. ✓ Bob should see the message
3. In Bob's window: Type "Hi Alice!" → Press Enter
4. ✓ Alice should see it

**B. Test Video (1 minute)**
⚠️ **Note:** macOS will ask for Camera permission - ALLOW IT!

1. In Alice's window: Click **"Start Video"**
2. ✓ Alice's webcam appears in video grid
3. ✓ Bob sees Alice's video
4. In Bob's window: Click **"Start Video"**
5. ✓ Both see 2 videos in grid

**C. Test Audio (30 seconds)**
⚠️ **Note:** Use headphones or be on separate computers to avoid echo!

1. In Alice's window: Click **"Start Audio"**
2. In Bob's window: Click **"Start Audio"**
3. Alice speaks → Bob hears
4. Bob speaks → Alice hears
5. ✓ Two-way audio works!

**D. Test Screen Sharing (1 minute)**
⚠️ **Note:** macOS will ask for Screen Recording permission - ALLOW IT!

1. In Alice's window: Click **"Start Presenting"**
2. ✓ Bob's screen sharing area shows "Alice is presenting..."
3. ✓ Bob sees Alice's screen
4. ✓ Bob's "Start Presenting" button is DISABLED
5. In Alice's window: Click **"Stop Presenting"**
6. ✓ Presentation stops

**E. Test File Sharing (1 minute)**
1. Create a test file first (in any terminal):
   ```bash
   echo "This is a test file" > ~/Desktop/test.txt
   ```

2. In Alice's window: 
   - Click **"Upload File"**
   - Navigate to Desktop
   - Select `test.txt`
   - Click Open
   - ✓ Success message appears

3. In Bob's window:
   - ✓ File appears in "File Sharing" list
   - Click on `test.txt` to select it
   - Click **"Download Selected"**
   - Choose save location (e.g., Desktop as `downloaded_test.txt`)
   - ✓ File downloads successfully

4. Verify:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Desktop/downloaded_test.txt
   # Should show: "This is a test file"
   ```

## 🐛 IF YOU ENCOUNTER ISSUES

### Issue: "Camera permission denied"
**Solution:**
1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Camera
2. Check the box for "Terminal" or "Python"
3. Restart the client

### Issue: "Microphone not working"
**Solution:**
1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Microphone
2. Enable for Terminal/Python
3. Restart the client

### Issue: "Screen recording permission"
**Solution:**
1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Screen Recording
2. Enable for Terminal/Python
3. **Restart Terminal** (important!)
4. Restart the client

### Issue: "Module not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Can't see other user's video"
**Cause:** This is normal on same computer - each camera can only be used by one app
**Solution:** Test video feature by:
- Starting video on Client 1
- Seeing it on Client 2
- Stop Client 1 video
- Start Client 2 video
- See it on Client 1
